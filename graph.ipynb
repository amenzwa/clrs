    "# Graph Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a tuple of the vertex set $V$ and the edge set $E$. So, we begin by defining the `Vert` and the `Edge` types and their respective sets. There are two common representations of graphs: adjacency matrix and adjacency list. The adjacency matrix representation is convenient for dense graphs. We will not come across dense graphs until the later chapters. So, we shall begin with the adjacency list representation. See ¬ß20.1 *Representations of graphs* p.549.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do note that because this notebook defines the fundamental graph representations, we factored out the tests, whcih perform printing and drawing, into the [`graphtest.ipynb`](./graphtest.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, the Python `import` statement can only import Python modules, but not Jupyter notebooks. This is why you must recite those magical incantations at the very top of this notebook. Indeed, they must appear in every notebook that imports other notebooks. This notebook, for instance, imports [`util.ipynb`](./util.ipynb). The `import_ipynb` module, which is installed when you ran the `pip3 install -r ~/Documents/clrs/requirements.txt` command during JLD installation, patches the Jupyter runtime to allow importing notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *vertex*\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define the `Vert` type. Because graph algorithms label the vertices and edges, we derive `Vert` from the `Tagged` base type, which is defined in [`util.ipynb`](./util.ipynb) notebook. And these algorithms store some state data in the vertex to keep track of progress as it explores the input graph. The `par` variable points to the parent vertex, the one from which the current vertex was discovered. But since a root vertex has no parent, we assign this variable the `Option[Vert]` type. The `Option` utility type is also defined in the `util` notebook. During construction of the vertex, we initialise `par` to `None`. The `dis` variable is the time the vertex was discovered. It is set to `Infinity` during initialisation. The `fin` variable is the time when processing of the vertex finished. It is used only by DFS, and is initialised to `-Infinity`, since a valid finish time can never be smallter than a valid discover time. And the `col` variable is the vertex colour. `White` means the vertex has not been explored. `Gray` means the vertex has been discovered. And `Black` means the vertex has been fully processed. All vertices are `White` at the start of a graph search algorithm. Here, we added `init()`, so that we may call it to reinitialise the vertex, later.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are objectively pedantic, we would have defined the `BFVert` type for breadth-first search (BFS) and the `DFVert` for depth-first search (DFS), and `fin` would be a member only of `DFVert`. But since these are simple, elementary algorithms used everywhere, it is better not to over complicate the matter and settle for a less elegant but more convenient combined type `Vert`."

    "Since graph search algorithms produce trees as their results, we need to define the tree type, as well. But a tree is conveniently represented as a graph. So, we define the `VE` type as the base class for both graph and tree. Furthermore, since we will need both the adjacency list and the adjacency matrix representations, we make `VE` an abstract base class, and derive `LstVE` and `MtxVE` from it. Note that we could use `Tuple[VSet, ESet]` to represent `VE`; that would be mathematically accurate. Computationally, though, it is more convenient to derive `VE` from `Tagged`. We may then use the tag in debugging and logging graphs and trees.\n",

In mathematical, scientific, and engineering computing‚Äîunlike in business [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)ing‚Äîwe use short variable names, often single-letter names. And our functions tend to have very short names, too. The reason is plain. In technical computing, we always know what we must implement, because we have either derived and proved the equations and the algorithms ourselves or we lifted them off an authoritative textbook. In order that we may verify the correctness of our code readily by visual inspection, us make our code resemble as close as possible to the equations and the algorithms in the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we document our code with chapter, section, and page citation to source. In this line of work, we do not subscribe to that abhorent twin motto of IT: \"Real men do not document; the code is the document. And real men do not comment; long variable names are the comments.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other differences between the two fields. In business CRUDing, the data structures tend to be rather complicated, but there really are no algorithms to speak of, let alone complicated ones. By contrast, in technical computing, the lists and queues are the common data structures, but the algorithms can be quite intricate. In other words, business CRUDing complexities are in the data structure, whereas technical computing complexities are in the code structure. Using short names make our code compact, and the compact code allows us to see the whole algorithm on the screen at once, thereby enabling us to gain a better purchase upon the code."
